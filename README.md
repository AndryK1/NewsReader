There is my new app to test my skills. I hope the app will be beautiful, and I want to test all the basic principles of creating a good app.

What is in this app now?

1. Done using the mvvm pattern along with the principles of clean architecture
2. The key point is of course working with material3 and retrofit 2 components to perform network requests
3. Using nav graph
4. Using glide
5. Using koin for convenient dependency injection
6. Using coroutines for convenient working with streams
7. Using viewBinding to reduce code and provide easier access to view elements
9. 100% kotlin language

What will this app have in future?

1. Room to work with database
2. Ability to share the news with friends
3. Different themes and styles
4. Work with Json
5. Work with android SDK
